I'm keeping this repo public, because I think it'll be a nice documentation of when I first learnt how to do front-end code.
Its also good to see how far you've come.
This repo was created for my interactive media class in Bachelor of Design (Digital Media) in 2024 Semester 2 I think.
This was the first time I've used code.
